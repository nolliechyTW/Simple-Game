# Simple_Game

In this project, I implement a simple game.  The game has 2 options for the user to play based on user input.
The user can choose to either convert time, from seconds to hours, minutes, and seconds, or calculate the sum of all digits in an integer by inputting either 1 or 2, to indicate which option of the game they want to play.

For example, if the user enters 1 and then 6734, the program will print the time, 1:52:14. 
If the user enters 2 and then 412,  the program will print the sum, 7, because 4 + 1 + 2 = 7.
